```
Hello Github!
```

## About this repo: 

- Repository0 was my first repository, and its contents have been moved here to cut down numbers of unnecessary repos. 
- I would type something that yields `hello github` in each of the files in this repository, If possible. 

I'm a pythoner and don't believe in what language this repo is marked. It's just ridiculous and unreasonable for this multi-language repo!
