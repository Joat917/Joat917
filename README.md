- Hi, I'm Joat917 from China. 
- I'm just interesting of creating types of stuff that I (rather than any other one) love. It is me that make all the requirements; it is on my own that I finish all the codes. 
- Visit [my homepage](https://joat917.github.io/) and find something useful (or entertaining) to you! 
- Joat (Jack of all trades) refers to someone that knows a little about a considerable number of skills, but not good at any of them. This suits perfectly with me, since I cope with computers a lot but hardly solves real-world problems when they show up.
- Joat literally means a three-legged cat in Chinese. That's why I'm using an orange cat for my website's icon. And the number '917' is just similar shape with the first 3 letters of 'github'. (So you might find Joat%any% elsewhere, but the number is changing)
- I have no facebook/twitter/instagram/reddit/google/tiktok account whatsoever. That's too bad...
