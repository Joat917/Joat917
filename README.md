- Hi, I'm Joat917 from cn. (the number might be different but it's me)
- I'm interested in ... maybe python? or js? or just wandering the ocean of coding? who knows?
- I'm currently stuck deeply in the breathtaking education system of east asia, 
    so i won't go here quite often, once a year or twice? it depends.
- I’m looking to collaborate on taking as little time on coding as possible to pass the tests. 
- You can reach me after i graduates, can't you? 
...
