- Hi, I'm Joat917 from China. 
- I'm just interesting of creating types of stuff that I (rather than any other one) love. It is me that make all the requirements; it is on my own that I finish all the codes. 
- Sometimes you'll find my pages or codes written somewhat in Chinese. It's simply because I'm too lazy to translate it into the way everybody likes. Get your translator ready. 
- I'm always busy doing my homework. See you later.
